## Daphnia Article

This repository contains the necessary code to reproduce the article: *Mechanistic models for panel data: Analysis of ecological experiments with four interacting species*.

### Compile MS

The manuscript is self-contained and can be generated by knitting the `ms.Rnw` file in the `daphnia-article` folder.

**Note:** The majority of expensive computations are done in separate `R` scripts in another repository, but there are a few calculations (including simulation and pomp object creation) that occur within `ms.Rnw`.

You can knit the file in multiple ways; for example, to run it on a cluster:

```
Rscript -e "library(knitr); knit2pdf('ms.Rnw')"
```

#### Compile SI 

The supplementary material in `si/si.Rnw` is **independent** of the main manuscript. To compile all supplementary `.Rnw` files, you can do the following in the si folder:

```
Rscript -e "library(knitr); knit2pdf('si.Rnw')"
```
